# CRABS: Congruent Rate Analysis in Birth-death Scenarios

A package for investigating and visualizing the congruence class (Louca & Pennell 2020) of a phylogenetic birth-death model. Previously, this package went by the acronym `ACDC`.

## Installation:

The stable version can be installed from CRAN:

    install.packages("CRABS")

The developmental version can be installed from the github repository. The package `devtools` makes this convenient:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("afmagee/CRABS")

## Documentation

There is documentation for each function in R (type `?CRABS` in the R-console), as well as a long-form vignette with an [example workflow](https://afmagee.github.io/CRABS/).
